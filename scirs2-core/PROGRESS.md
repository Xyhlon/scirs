## Recent Implementations

### Memory Metrics System

A comprehensive memory metrics system has been implemented for tracking and analyzing memory usage:

- **Memory Event Tracking**: Event-based tracking for allocations, deallocations, and resizes
- **Component-level Statistics**: Detailed stats for each component in the system
- **Memory Usage Reports**: Human-readable and JSON reports
- **Memory Snapshots**: Point-in-time analysis of memory usage
- **Leak Detection**: Compare snapshots to identify potential memory leaks
- **Thread-safety**: Concurrent access to the memory metrics system
- **Visualization**: Text-based visualization of memory usage changes
- **Tracked Components**: Buffer pools, chunk processors, and GPU buffers with automatic tracking

### Examples

Complete examples demonstrating memory metrics functionality:

- Basic memory metrics usage (`memory_metrics_example.rs`)
- Buffer pool tracking (`memory_metrics_bufferpool.rs`)
- Chunk processor tracking (`memory_metrics_chunking.rs`)
- GPU memory tracking (`memory_metrics_gpu.rs`)
- Memory snapshots and leak detection (`memory_metrics_snapshots.rs`)

## Implementation Status

All core functionality has been implemented and tested. The memory metrics system is fully operational with the following features:

- [x] Memory event tracking (allocations, deallocations, resizes)
- [x] Memory metrics collection and aggregation
- [x] Memory usage reporting
- [x] Memory snapshots
- [x] Memory leak detection
- [x] Thread-safe operation
- [x] Integration with other memory management components
- [x] Integration with GPU memory tracking

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the memory metrics system:

- [ ] More visualization options (charts, graphs)
- [ ] Integration with profiling system
- [ ] Automated reporting on potential optimizations
- [ ] Memory usage prediction based on historical data
- [ ] Advanced leak detection with heuristics
- [ ] Support for additional memory-related metrics (fragmentation, allocation patterns)
