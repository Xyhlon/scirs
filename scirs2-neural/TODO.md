# scirs2-neural TODO

This module provides neural network building blocks and functionality for deep learning.

## Current Status

- [x] Neural network building blocks (layers, activations, loss functions)
- [x] Backpropagation infrastructure 
- [x] Model architecture implementations
- [x] Training utilities and metrics

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Fix build errors and warnings in the current implementation
- [ ] Improve integration with scirs2-autograd
- [ ] Add more layer types (Convolutional, Recurrent, Attention, etc.)
- [ ] Implement more activation functions
- [ ] Implement more loss functions
- [ ] Add more model architectures
- [ ] Improve batch operations performance
- [ ] Add data loaders and dataset utilities
- [ ] Implement model checkpointing and serialization
- [ ] Add model validation and evaluation utilities
- [ ] Implement early stopping and other training utilities
- [ ] Add visualization tools for network architecture and training

## Long-term Goals

- [ ] Create a high-level API for training and evaluation
- [ ] Support for transfer learning
- [ ] Support for model deployment
- [ ] Integration with popular deep learning frameworks
- [ ] GPU acceleration
- [ ] Distributed training support
